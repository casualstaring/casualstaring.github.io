Breaks my little heart. I love teddy and his weird little quirks of running in circles like a maniac, but I also understand that I don't live with him and I don't hold responsibility for him. My parents largely have to carry the burden for any horrible thing that teddy might do, as well as his freakishness when going to vets/groomers. I understand why it should be done; I want him to stay for selfish reasons. Whenever I look at Teddy, all I think about is his impending death. It feels as if I am staring at someone on death row. He looks so innocent 99% of the time, but whenever he sees a dog, his eyes glaze oevr and he turns into a violent creature. I wish we succeeded in training out his violent tendencies towards his own kind. Sadly, his episodic violence seems to be permanent, he is 8 years old now and he has stayed the same, if not gotten worse. Despite his misanthropy (the dog version?), I will miss him. I wish that gate wasn't left open by the people moving the cabinet in the back. I wish I went to the backyard for whatever reason to find out that the gate was open. The dog that was injured didn't even have to get stitches; the vet just cleaned them up, gave them antiobiotics, and sent them home. Teddy is going to be killed due to him causing a couple a couple of flesh wounds. WHAT I FUCKING IDIOT. One of the biggest shocks from this incident was how quick my parents came to this decison, I wasn't aware of how stressed they were all the time about Teddy's violent tendencies.
