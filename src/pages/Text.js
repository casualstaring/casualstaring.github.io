		<h3>* Monday 21122020 [%] - A day hike in SB with michael and marisa</h3>
		<p className='list'>
			** 21122020 Summary
			Marisa, Michael, and I drove to Santa Barbara to do the Jesuit hiking trail. It was an overall great trip,
			but our
			conversation on the way back really elevated it to another level. Note that today is the winter solstice.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			** 21122020 Car Conversation: <br/>
			(Everything is paraphrased) <br/>
			<br/>
			*** Contextualizing your art <br/>
			michael - How do you contextualize your art around other people? Are your articulation of ideas motivated by
			some
			inner desires, or external? <br/>
			<br/>
			jack - I have found started to emphasize communication. Art derives its meaning by how well it can
			communicated
			ideas (even if those ideas are some more nuanced 'hard-to-pin-down'). I want to craft objects/experiences
			that
			communicate ideas that are harder to explain using words (atmospheres, emotions, loose narratives, etc). ETC
			ETC,
			write this better. <br/>
			<br/>
			marisa - I'm not sure, as I have done many art stuff lately, but I do know that I tend to have humble
			reasons for
			arts. I find an action that I enjoy, so I keep doing it. Simple and monotonous actions busy the body, giving
			freedom
			to the mind to wander. Some artifact just happens to pop out at the end. <br/>
			<br/>
			jack & marisa - michael? <br/>
			<br/>
			michael - I have really been enjoying objects lately. I like to force images and concepts into your mind
			that
			wouldn't have been there otherwise. For example, take an image of a bowling ball; you look and there it is,
			a
			bowling ball taking shape in your mind. I have been wanting to put a bowling ball in a spoon. There are just
			so
			many
			things and potential concepts in the world, I just want to carve out and document the things that affect me,
			the
			things that constantly loop through my mind as I fall asleep (bowling balls, cones, electrical boxes, etc).
			If the
			viewer doesn't find value in these objects, that's okay; I just think it is important for myself to
			document. <br/>
			- jack sidenote : I love the idea of someone who can't fall asleep because they are obssesed with the image
			of a
			bowling ball in a spoon. <br/>
			- jack sidenote : Michael seems to be overwhelmed by the size of the set of possible configurations of
			objects. He
			attempts to carve out and curate the objects and ideas that he finds meaningful in this vast possibility
			space. He
			is almost attempting to build a language to describe the niche, kinda out there concepts that he finds
			important.
			To
			a normative western culture, we might invent the word 'dog' as they are important and helpful creatures in
			our
			lives. For michael, he might invent a "word" (aka documentation) to describe the imagery of spell checking
			some
			grafitti on an electric box, or the imagery of a bowling ball in spoon. These concepts affect him deeply
			enough
			and
			often enough to require a linguistic anchor (aka word/documentation). <br/>
			------ <br/>
			<br/>
			*** Half thoughts or half ddeas <br/>
			Main Point : How does each of us deal with verbalizing a thought that isn't fully fleshed out. This usually
			leads
			to
			stuttering and awkward/confusing interactions with your listener. <br/>
			<br/>
			michael and marisa - While saying the thought, they realize it isn't fully fleshed out. Once they
			acknowledge
			this,
			they attempt to cut-off their own sentence and encourage the person they are having a conversation with to
			move on
			to a new topic. <br/>
			<br/>
			jack - While saying the thought, they realize it isn't fully fleshed out. Once they acknowledge this, they
			attempt
			to pass the burden of piecing together the idea to their listener. It is almost as if he is determined to
			finish
			the
			idea by any means necessary; this requires the help of others. <br/>
			- jack sidenote: I do it this way as I am largely influenced by my experiences with learning math. When
			trying to
			figure out a concept with a professor, I am forced to splay out all my half thoughts for inspection by my
			professor.
			This is the best way to communicate to your professor what you don't know, so they can help you. It is
			incredibly
			embarassing at first, but it eventually humbles you and makes you more open to thinking deeply with other
			people.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			*** Talking at people and talking to yourself <br/>
			Sometimes we start talking to people with no intention of having a two-sided conversation; we call this
			talking at
			someone. One of the main reasons for someone doing such an annoying thing is that they want to work out some
			ideas
			they have in there head in a more explicit manner. Talking to oneself is deemed odd, so that leaves us with
			the
			strategy of talking at someone. <br/>

			- 'The reason I think fan games are so popular is that creating an original idea and expanding upon one are

			- pg 126 -- finishing a game (or any creative project) <br/>
			- 'I’m obsessed with finishing as a skill. Over the years, I’ve realized that so many of the good things

			- 'We’re not human beings when we estimate how long something will take—we’re unstoppable robots fueled by

			- 'As my hero Hannah Arendt puts it: “The presence of others who see what we see and hear what we hear
			assures us
			of
			the reality of the world and ourselves.”' <br/>
			- 'The people working on the “Eternal Daughter killers” weren’t amateurs. They were phenomenal artists,

			and programmers who just happened to suck at finishing projects. They obviously learned a lot from
			reiterating on
			the same early sections, but they never learned how to navigate that wasteland or overcome that consummate
			destroyer
			of dreams: being too much of a perfectionist. As a result, they never learned that with each game you

			** Some thoughts about the day. <br/>
			This was the day Teddy was accidentally let out (for the second time), attacking a dog. My parents have
			decided
			the
			only ethical option is to put teddy down. Breaks my little heart. I love teddy and his weird little quirks
			of
			running in circles like a maniac, but I also understand that I don't live with him and I don't hold
			responsibility
			for him. My parents largely have to carry the burden for any horrible thing that teddy might do, as well as
			his
			freakishness when going to vets/groomers. I understand why it should be done; I want him to stay for selfish
			reasons. Whenever I look at Teddy, all I think about is his impending death. It feels as if I am staring at
			someone
			on death row. He looks so innocent 99% of the time, but whenever he sees a dog, his eyes glaze oevr and he
			turns
			into a violent creature. I wish we succeeded in training out his violent tendencies towards his own kind.
			Sadly,
			his
			episodic violence seems to be permanent, he is 8 years old now and he has stayed the same, if not gotten
			worse.
			Despite his misanthropy (the dog version?), I will miss him. I wish that gate wasn't left open by the people
			moving
			the cabinet in the back. I wish I went to the backyard for whatever reason to find out that the gate was
			open. The
			dog that was injured didn't even have to get stitches; the vet just cleaned them up, gave them antiobiotics,
			and
			sent them home. Teddy is going to be killed due to him causing a couple a couple of flesh wounds. WHAT I
			FUCKING
			IDIOT. One of the biggest shocks from this incident was how quick my parents came to this decison, I wasn't
			aware
			of
			how stressed they were all the time about Teddy's violent tendencies. I suppose it makes sense in
			retrospect, as
			my
			dad seems to actively hate teddy nowadays, even before this incident. <br/>
